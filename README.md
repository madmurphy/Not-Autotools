Not Autotools
=============

A collection of awesome and self-documented *M4-ish* macros for GNU Autotools


Overview
--------

This collection is still very small. The macros are organized by topic and each topic has its own file. Most of the macros are independent from each other, so you can just copy and paste what you need. The few cases where a macro depends on a helper macro from the same file are documented.

Feel free to contribute. For any question, [drop me a message][1].
